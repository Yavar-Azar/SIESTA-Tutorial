Charge analysis
============================

:math:`n({\bf r})` as an scalar function of position can be written in so-called
**cube** format

The are several Utilities in Siesta package to convert siesta file (LABEL.RHO) to
cube (xsf) format
#. grid2cube
#. rho2xsf
#. denchar

grid2cube
*********

**Usage**
This program reads files generated from SIESTA, with information of
physical quantities on the real space grid, such as charge densities
(``filename.RHO, filename.DRHO, filename.LDOS``) or potentials (``filename.VH,
filename.VT``) and translates them to the Gaussian CUBE format, that
can be used as an input for visualization packages like VESTA and
Avogadro.

The program needs three input files:

1) Main input file, read by standard input. A sample of input file (grid2cube.in) is:
  .. code-block::

    systemLabel
    rho
    4.0 6.0 5.0
    1
    unformatted

where:
  - The first line is the label of the system, as in SIESTA SystemLabel.
    Files will be searched as SystemLabel.* (in the example, h2o.RHO).
  - The second line is the task, which should be one of the following:
    rho, drho, ldos, vh or vt (in lowercase!!).
  - The third line is a shift of the origin of coordinates (in bohr).
  - The forth line is an integer (nskip) that specifies the density of
    grid points in the output.

Compile:
    go to the siesta home directory and
    ``cd $siesta/Utility/grid``
    and
    ``make``

    This will compile files in grid directory and makes several executable files
    grid2cube, grid2xsf,...

    put these files in path

we can run it
``grid2cube < rid2cube.in``
