Crystal Structure and CIF format
--------------------------------
"In crystallography, crystal structure is a description of the ordered arrangement of atoms,
ions or molecules in a crystalline material. Ordered structures occur from the intrinsic nature of the constituent particles to
form symmetric patterns that repeat along the principal directions of three-dimensional space in matter.

The smallest group of particles in the material that constitutes this repeating pattern is the unit
cell of the structure. The unit cell completely reflects the symmetry and structure of the entire crystal,
which is built up by repetitive translation of the unit cell along its principal axes.
The translation vectors define the nodes of the **Bravais lattice**." *Wikipedia*

There are many tools to visualize a CIF (Crystallographic Information Framework) file or
convert it to the geometrical setup for various electronic structure codes.
Here, we introduce some of the most widely used one,

GUI Visualizers
    * `VESTA <http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/>`_to visualize cif file and create standard figures for publication
    .. Download a cif file and open it by VEST, Try to show dihedrals and detect different planes.
    * `XCrySDen <http://www.xcrysden.org/>`_ to visualize xsf, cube, pwi, ... files
    * `gdis <https://github.com/arohl/gdis>`_ ti visualize siesta input files (fdf)
    .. Using gdis save a cif file as a siesta input.

Command line convertor
    * `CIF2CELL <https://sourceforge.net/projects/cif2cell/>`_
    after installation you can concert any cif file to siesta input file
    ::
      $ cif2cell example.cif -p siesta
    this command creates a fdf file with same name as cif file

.. topic:: Exercise
  Download :file:`CsPbI3.fdf` and use cif2cell to generate structural file
  after `cif2cell CsPbI3.cif -p siesta`
  you can find the CsPbI3.fdf
