In crystallography, crystal structure is a description of the ordered arrangement of atoms,
ions or molecules in a crystalline material. Ordered structures occur from the intrinsic nature of the constituent particles to
form symmetric patterns that repeat along the principal directions of three-dimensional space in matter.

The smallest group of particles in the material that constitutes this repeating pattern is the unit
cell of the structure. The unit cell completely reflects the symmetry and structure of the entire crystal,
which is built up by repetitive translation of the unit cell along its principal axes.
The translation vectors define the nodes of the :yimp:`Bravais lattice`." *Wikipedia*

Lattice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A crystal structure is formed only when the group of atoms is arranged identically at the lattice point.
The group of atoms or molecules is called a :yimp:`basis`. Lattice point is actually an **imaginary concept**.

Unit cell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unit cell can be considered as the building block of a crystal.
It has the same symmetry as the entire crystal.
When we arrange the unit cell in 3D, we get the bulk crystal.
In other words it can be described as the smallest volume which when repeated
in all direction gives the crystal. The three edges a, b, c along the axis and
angle between them :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta` and :math:`\gamma` is termed as lattice parameters.
In 3D it is better to consider a parallelepiped as unit cell. For more details see :cite:`kittel2005`

:yimp:`Bravais lattice` A collection of points in which the neighborhood of each
point is the same as the neighborhood of every other point under some translation is
called a Bravais lattice.


:yimp:`Lattice vectors` represent the edges of a unit cell of a lattice. They are not necessarily
mutually orthogonal. A linear combination of lattice vectors, with integral parameters,
can represent every vector that belongs to the lattice.

.. math::

   \vec{T}_{mno} = m \, \vec{a}_1 + n \, \vec{a}_2 + o \,\vec{a}_3 \qquad m,n,o \in \mathbb{Z} \; \label{eq:threeDimTranslVector}


On the other hand, contents of the unit cell is described by means of appropriate
set of :yimp:`basis vectors` :math:`\vec{d_1}, \vec{d_2}, \vec{d_3}, ...., \vec{d_n}`
where *n* is the number of all atoms in the unit cell. The position of the atom
can be written as

.. math::

	\vec{R}=\vec{T}+\vec{d_\nu}


**Example** Write down *d* vectors for the GaAs in its conventional and primitive cell

:yimp:`Wigner-Seitz cell` The Wigner-Seitz cell is a polyhedron obtained by connecting
a lattice point P to all other lattice points and drawing the planes
perpendicular to these connecting lines and passing through
their midpoints. (Visualize it with xcrysden for your own cif file)

Crystal symmetry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The space groups in three dimensions are made from combinations of the
``32 crystallographic point groups`` with the ``14 Bravais lattices``
, each of the latter belonging to one of 7 lattice systems.

:yimp:`Bilbao Crystallographic Server` is an open access website offering online
crystallographic database and programs aimed at analyzing, calculating and
visualizing problems of structural and mathematical crystallography,
solid state physics and structural chemistry.

Lattice planes and directions in crystals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:yimp:`Miller indices` form a notation system in crystallography
for planes in crystal (Bravais) lattices.
In particular, a family of lattice planes is determined
by three integers h, k, and l, the Miller indices.

Distance between planes for each system can be calculated from

Reciprocal lattice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the study of crystals, besides the direct lattice in the ordinary space,
it is important to consider also the reciprocal lattice in the dual (or reciprocal) space.
Given a crystal with primitive translation vectors :math:`\vec{a_1}, \vec{a_2}, \vec{a_3}`
in the direct space, we consider the three primitive vectors :math:`\vec{g_1}, \vec{g_2}, \vec{g_3}`
in the :yimp:`reciprocal space`, defined by the relations

.. math::

	\vec{a_i}\cdot \vec{g_j}=2\pi\delta_{ij}

:yimp:`Reciprocal lattice vector`

  .. math::

  	\vec{G_m}=m_1\vec{g_1}+m_1\vec{g_2}+m_1\vec{g_3}

:yimp:`Brillouin zone` is a uniquely defined primitive cell in reciprocal space.



**Relation between lattice planes and reciprocal lattice**

Therefore, it appears that the moduli of the perpendicular vectors :math:`\sigma_{hkl}`
reciprocal to the interplanar spacings. The end points of these vectors
(blue arrows in figure below) also produce a periodic lattice that,
due to this reciprocal property, is known as the reciprocal lattice of the original direct lattice.
The reciprocal points obtained in this way (green points in figure below)
are identified with the same numerical triplets hkl (Miller indices) which represent the corresponding plane family.

A Brillouin zone is a particular choice of the unit cell of the
reciprocal lattice. It is defined as the Wigner-Seitz cell (also
called Dirichlet or Voronoi domain of influence) of the reciprocal
lattice. It is constructed as the set of points enclosed by the Bragg
planes, the planes perpendicular to a connection line from the origin
to each lattice point and passing through the midpoint (see figure).
Alternatively, it is defined as the set of points closer to the origin
than to any other reciprocal lattice point. :ynice:`The whole reciprocal space may
be covered without overlap with copies of such a Brillouin zone`.
