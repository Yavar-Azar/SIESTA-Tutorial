Crystal structure Visualizers
======================================


There are many tools to visualize a CIF (Crystallographic Information Framework) file or
convert it to the geometrical setup for various electronic structure codes.
Here, we introduce some of the most widely used one,

VESTA
---------------------------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`VESTA <http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/>`_ to visualize cif file and create
standard figures for publication.
Download compressed code from `this link <http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/archives/3.4.8/VESTA-gtk3.tar.bz2>`_
and extract it somewhere in your soft bank, you can open terminal in
the directory of compressed file and type

.. code-block:: bash

  tar -xvf VESTA-gtk2.tar.bz2
  cd VESTA-gtk2

You can find a an executable ``VESTA`` file,
which can be executed typing ``./VESTA`` in terminal.
It is better to add file address to path,
copy the address of binary file address with ``pwd`` command,

Then add it to the end of your ``.bashrc`` file as follows

.. code-block:: bash

  export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/VESTA/file


Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download a cif file (:download:`./CsPbI3.cif`) and open it by vesta

.. code-block:: bash

  VESTA CsPbI3.cif


You can see several tools in the *Horizontal* and *Vertical* toolbar

- Using tools in vertical toolbar measure some distances, angles, dihedrals in the structure
- Try different display styles and visualize octahedral(s)
- Show different lattice planes
- Open cif files for GaAs :download:`./GaAs_prim.cif` and :download:`GaAs_conven.cif` with VESTA and read cell volume from output window

 .. note::

 	Notice the ratio between volume of conventional and primitive cell, can you explain it?


XCrySDen
----------------------------------

Download and Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`XCrySDen <http://www.xcrysden.org/>`_ is a tool visualize xsf, QW in/outputs
(pwi, pwo) files and volumetric data included in ``.cube|.xsf`` files

Download `Linux x86_64 binary packages <http://www.xcrysden.org/download/xcrysden-1.6.2-linux_x86_64-shared.tar.gz>`_
and extract it to a directory, as you did for VESTA and put ``xcrysden`` binary
in path

.. code-block:: bashrc

    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/xcrysden/file

Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here we can compare primitive and conventional cell for GaAs diamond structure.
Get two xsf files :download:`GaAs_prim.xsf`  and :download:`GaAs_conven.xsf` and
open files

.. code-block:: language

  xcrysden --xsf GaAs_prim.xsf

- Go to the ``display`` menu and check different utilities.
- From ``Tools`` open ``k-path selection`` check BZ for both conventional and primitive cells
- Select a k-path in BZ and save your selected path in a text file


.. figure:: ./Figs/xcrysden.png
   :align: center







GDIS
------------------------------------

`gdis <https://github.com/arohl/gdis>`_ to visualize siesta input files (fdf) Using gdis save a cif file as a siesta input.


CIF2CELL
--------------------------------------
CIF2Cell is a tool to generate the geometrical setup for various
electronic structure codes from a CIF (Crystallographic Information Framework) file.
The program currently supports output for a number of popular electronic structure programs,
including ABINIT, ASE, CASTEP, CP2K, CPMD, CRYSTAL09, Elk, EMTO, Exciting,
Fleur, FHI-aims, Hutsepot, MOPAC, Quantum Espresso, RSPt, Siesta, SPR-KKR, VASP.
Also exports some related formats like .coo, .cfg and .xyz-files.




Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download code from this `link <https://sourceforge.net/projects/cif2cell/>`_ and extract downloaded file
Go to the source directory you can see a ``setup.py`` and Then

.. code-block:: language

  python setup.py install --prefix=where/you/want/it


after installation check arguments with ``cif2cell -h``



Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generate QE and SIESTA input file from the downloaded cif files

.. code-block:: language

  cif2cell GaAs_conven.cif -p siesta

you can find siesta input file in the same directory
